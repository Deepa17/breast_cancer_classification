# breast_cancer_classification
A Matlab project to perform breast cancer tumor classification as benign or malignant
<h2>Description of the files:</h2>
<h4>
 preprocessing.m : Preprocessing the input data
 data_vis.mlx : Visualising the data
 ml_input_data.m : Data split into test and train sets
 discrminant_analysis.m : Train the classification model discriminant analysis
 decision_tree.m : Train the classification model decision tree 
 knn.m : Train K Nearest Neighbours on the data
 svm.m : Train SVM on the model
 model_outputs.m: Output of the metrics of all the model
  </h4>

<h2>Steps to run the files: </h2>
<h4>
  1. Load all the files into a single folder 
  2. Run "preprocessing.m" to preprocess data for training and visualising
  3. Run "data_vis.mlx" to visualise the input data
  4. Run "ml_input_data.m" to get the data for testing and training
  5. Then run the files "discriminant_analysis.m", "decision_tree.m",
       "svm.m","knn.m" (in no particular order) to train all the models
  6. Run "model_outputs.m" to get the metrics of the trained models
